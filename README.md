All of things i've learned from https://developers.google.com/web/

## Knowledge

- Launch Android Emulators and iOS Simulators From the Command Line

```terminal
$ emulator -list-avds   # Lists all AVDs you currently have configured
$ emualtor -avd {name}
```

```terminal
$ open -a Simulator
```

- Use `10.0.2.2` to access actual machine localhost in the Android emulator.
